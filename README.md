# Hands-on Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch
This is the code repository for [Hands-on Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Reinforcement-Learning-with-PyTorch), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
PyTorch, Facebook's deep learning framework, is clear, easy to code and easy to debug, thus providing a straightforward and simple experience for developers.
This course is your hands-on guide to the core concepts of deep reinforcement learning and its implementation in PyTorch. We will help you get your PyTorch environment ready before moving on to the core concepts that encompass deep reinforcement learning.
Following a practical approach, you will build reinforcement learning algorithms and develop/train agents in simulated OpenAI Gym environments. You'll learn the skills you need to implement deep reinforcement learning concepts so you can get started building smart systems that learn from their own experiences.
By the end of this course, you will have enhanced your knowledge of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and will be confident enough to effectively use PyTorch to build your RL projects.
